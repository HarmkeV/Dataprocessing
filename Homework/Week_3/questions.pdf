- Explain the difference between the == operator and the === operator. -
The == operator compares the value of the things that are to be compared and checks whether they
refer to the same string instance. The string instances thus have to be equal to be compared equal. If values
in a string are similar but their instances are different, the outcome of the boolean will be False.
 The === operator compares the absolute value of what is being compared. This means that
values have to be fully similar for the boolean to be considered True.

- Explain what a closure is. (Note that JavaScript programs use closures very often) -
A closure is a function that references bindings from local scopes around it. This means that the closure
enables the function to have access to the parent scope, even after it has been closed.

- Explain what higher order functions are. -
Higher order functions are functions that operate on other functions, either by taking them as arguments
or by returning them. There are several different higher order functions, such as functions that create
new functions, change other functions and write functions that provide new types of control flow.

- Explain what a query selector is and give an example line of JavaScript that uses a query selector. -
The query selector returns the first element that matches a specified CSS selector(s) in the document. It
returns only the first element that matches the description. An example of this is the line
"document.querySelector("p");", with which the first <p> element in the document is obtained.
